### Volunteering & Bounties

Most of the people who work on Group Income do so as volunteers. If you’d like to join our volunteer team, get in touch with us. We’re looking for designers, developers, and writers.

  

You can also get paid to work on Group Income without applying for a specific position by working on issues that [have bounties posted to them](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ANote%3ABounty). If an issue you’re interested in doesn’t have a bounty posted to it, feel free to request one [via our Slack](https://groupincome.org/community/) or [on Github](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/issues)!

  

Every regular contributor to the development of Group Income will be added to the Group Income Contributors Group, a special group for Group Income contributors that’s sustained by voluntary contributions from the larger network of groups.
